# 8-bit Barrel Shifter (Structural Modeling)

This project implements an **8-bit barrel shifter** using **structural modeling** in VHDL, targeted for simulation and synthesis using **Xilinx ISE Design Suite**. The design is built by connecting eight 8:1 multiplexers, enabling bit-wise rotation of an 8-bit data input.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Design Style**: Structural VHDL
- **Main Modules**:
  - `barrel_shifter_st`: Top-level structural entity for barrel shifter
  - `mux_8_1_st`: 8:1 multiplexer used to build the barrel shifter
- **Simulation**: Verified with a testbench `barrel_st_tb.vhd` in Xilinx ISE
- **Target Platform**: Any FPGA supported by Xilinx ISE

## ⚙️ How It Works

The barrel shifter takes an 8-bit input `d` and a 3-bit shift value `s`, and outputs the rotated result in `y`.

- The shift value `s` determines how many positions the bits are rotated.
- Each output bit is generated by a unique 8:1 multiplexer (`mux_8_1_st`), which selects the appropriate input bit based on the shift.

For example, with input:
d = "00001111" and s = "010"

The output would be a 2-bit left rotated version of `d`.

## 🧩 File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `barrel_shifter_st.vhd` | Top-level structural barrel shifter entity |
| `mux_8_1_st.vhd`        | 8:1 multiplexer module used by barrel shifter |
| `barrel_st_tb.vhd`      | Testbench to simulate barrel shifter behavior |

## 🛠️ How to Run in Xilinx ISE

1. **Create a new project** in Xilinx ISE.
2. **Add all three files**:
   - `barrel_shifter_st.vhd`
   - `mux_8_1_st.vhd`
   - `barrel_st_tb.vhd`
3. **Set `barrel_st_tb.vhd` as the top module** for simulation.
4. Click on **"Simulate Behavioral Model"** to observe waveforms.
5. Observe how input `d` and shift control `s` affect the output `y`.

## 🔍 Testbench Behavior

The testbench sequentially applies the following:

- Input `d = "00001111"`
- Varies shift `s` from `"000"` to `"111"` every 100 ns
- Waits indefinitely after testing all shift values

This demonstrates all 8 rotation configurations for the barrel shifter.

## 🧪 Sample Output (Conceptual)

| Shift `s` | Output `y` |
|-----------|------------|
| `000`     | `00001111` |
| `001`     | `00011110` |
| `010`     | `00111100` |
| `011`     | `01111000` |
| `100`     | `11110000` |
| `101`     | `11100000` |
| `110`     | `11000001` |
| `111`     | `10000011` |

*(Actual output depends on multiplexer implementation and rotation direction)*
